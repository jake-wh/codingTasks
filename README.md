# Coding Tasks

This repository contains some of my work whilst on my coding bootcamp!

## Contents:

- OOP - Modules: Task Manager

  This project required me to acquire an understanding of modularisation, and saw me produce a terminal based task manager application. This application allows users to create,
  edit and delete tasks, as well as set levels of prioritisation for them.

- OOP - Classes: Email Simulator

  This project required me to build a basic email simulator which allows for emails in an inbox to be viewed and marked as read.
